My 2nd introduction to github

My first introduction to Github was 2015 when i worked at ISSE Corporation. I don't think i quite got what it was all about and since i just used it a few times as i did very little coding i soon forgot all about it. 

Now I am at a point where i am trying to create a programming profile and just improve on my coding skills and i just need somewhere to store my stuff so that i can, when needed, showcase what i have done or can do.

So yea, I don't despise humble beginnings, I know it's long overdue that i advance my career but i'm taking baby steps and will get where i want to be. Become an asset. 

A journey of a thousand miles begins with one step and this here is one of my 'one step'...

I'm excited. 17 May 2019
